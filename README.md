# Fastr (HackCamp 2023 Winner)

## Introduction

Reading takes FOREVER, and we wanted to make it faster. Or... *Fastr*? For HackCamp2023,
my team of three decided to tackle the theme of inclusivity, accessibility, and diversity
by developing a tool that can make any piece of text quick and easy to read and digest.

## Using *Fastr*

*Fastr* is a Chrome extension that uses rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) to
increase users' reading speed by over 200%. Basically that means that this extension
takes the user's highlighted text on any page and displays it one word at a time, 
which optimizes reading speed by eliminating the need for users to move their eyes.
Other features include:
- Adjustable reading speed (users can decide how quickly the words flash)
- Pause/play buttons while reading
- Summary at the end of a reading with rundown of how many words were read in total and
at what speed they were read
